                <h1 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                <div><b>What is a Hackathon?</b><p>A Hackathon is an event that brings novice and experienced coders together in order to create innovative projects involving code.</p></div>
                <div><b>Do I need to know how to code?</b><p>No, you don't! Even if you aren't able to code beforehand, you can attend workshops, learn some code, and still submit a project.</p></div>
                <div><b>Who can attend?</b><p>C10 HAX is open to all high-school students. However, anyone is welcome to drop by and see what participants are working on.</p></div>
                <div><b>What if I don't have a team?</b><p>No problem! Many participants arrive without a team, and you can meet and work with new people. You can also choose to work alone. The limit is 4 people per team.</p></div>
                <div><b>What can I make?</b><p>For C10 HAX Spring 2018, you can code anything you want! Possibilities are websites, mobile or desktop apps, or even hardware projects.</p></div>
                <div><b>How much does it cost?</b><p>All Hackathons, including C10 HAX, are free! We provide food, beverages, workspaces, and "swag" (free stuff).</p></div>
                <div><b>What should I bring?</b><p>We recommend that you bring an ID (if you have one) and a laptop. Laptops aren't required, but it won't be easy to code on lined paper.</p></div>
                <div><b>Can I use past projects?</b><p>Anyone caught working on past projects will be forced to sit in the corner and wear the dunce hat. Seriously though, we discourage using old work.</p></div>
                <div><b>Will hardware be provided?</b><p>Well, we don't know yet. Updates will be provided as the hackathon draws nearer.</p></div>
                <div><b>How do I win?</b><p>The judges are looking for original, innovative, and well-functioning projects. Bonus points for a project with real-world applicability!</p></div>
                <div><b>Is there a code of conduct?</b><p>C10 HAX follows the<br> <a href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">MLH Code of Conduct</a>.</p></div>
